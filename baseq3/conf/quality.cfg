// === textures ===================================================================================

seta r_ext_compiled_vertex_array		"1"							// enables hardware compiled vertex array rendering method (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_ext_compressed_textures			"1"							// enables compression of textures (0: off, 1: on and faster on slower machines but can look ugly)
seta r_ext_multitexture					"0"							// enables hardware mutitexturing (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_ext_texture_env_add				"0"							// enables additive blending in multitexturing (0: opengl limits you to multiplicative blending only - so additive will require an extra pass, 1: on)
seta r_ext_max_anisotropy				"0"							// anisotropic filtering quality (2: default)
seta r_colorbits						"16"						// set number of bits used for each color (0, 16, 32)
seta r_depthbits						"16"						// set precision of z-buffer (0, 16, 32)
seta r_stencilbits						"4"							// stencil buffer size in bits, value decreases z-buffer (0 to 8)
seta r_texturebits						"16"						// set number of bits used for each texture (0 to 32)

seta r_texturemode						"GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST"	// texture interpolation mode
																	// - GL_NEAREST:		enable nearest neighbor interpolation and will therefore appear similar to quake 2 except with the added colored lighting
																	// - GL_LINEAR:			enable linear interpolation and will appear to blend in objects that are closer than the resolution that the textures are set as
																	// - GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST:	nearest neighbor interpolation with mipmapping for bilinear hardware, mipmapping will blend objects that are farther away than the resolution that they are set as
																	// - GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST:	linear interpolation with mipmapping for bilinear hardware
																	// - GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR:	nearest neighbor interpolation with mipmapping for trilinear hardware
																	// - GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR:	linear interpolation with mipmapping for trilinear hardware

seta r_detailtextures					"0"							// detailed textures (0: every stage of a shader is rendered except those with the keyword "detail", 1: detail stages are also rendered)
seta r_picmip							"16"						// general level of detail, used with cg_nomip (0: highest, 16: lowest)
seta r_subdivisions						"4"							// set maximum level of detail, for example the complexity of curves (0: highest)
seta r_lodbias							"2"							// defines detail quality of models
seta r_roundimagesdown					"1"							// set rounding down amount (lower: quality, larger: faster)
seta r_simplemipmaps					"0"							// "simple" mip mapping, used to "dumb-down" resolution displays for slower machines (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_faceplanecull					"1"							// culling of brush faces not in view (0: off slows down fps, 1: on)
seta r_fastsky							"1"							// disables sky texture and animation of portals (0: off slows down fps when outdoors, 1: on and disables to see through portals)
seta r_vbo								"1"							// quake3e: static world surfaces cached in VBO

// === lighting ===================================================================================

seta r_vertexlight						"1"							// vertex lighting, removes lightmaps, forces every shader to only use a single rendering pass, no layered transparancy, environment mapping, world lighting is completely static, and there is no dynamic lighting when in vertex lighting mode. (1: faster, lower quality than lightmap)
seta r_dynamiclight						"0"							// rendering dynamic lights (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_dlightbacks						"0"							// brighter areas are changed more by dynamic lights than darker areas (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_dlightmode						"0"							// quake3e: high quality per-pixel dynamic light mode
seta r_ambientscale						"0.6"						// intensity of ambient light on objects (lower: more intensity, higher: lesser intensity)
seta r_directedscale					"1"							// impact of ambient lights on objects (lower: darker, higher: brighter)
seta r_flares							"0"							// projectile flare and lighting effect, the flare effect is a translucent disk that is used to alter the colors around lights with a corona effect (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_drawsun							"0"							// rendering of sunlight into the equation of lighting effects (0: off, 1: on)

// === brightness =================================================================================

seta r_ext_gamma_control				"1"							// enables external gamma control settings (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_ignorehwgamma					"1"							// use directx gamma correction instead of video driver gamma correction (0: off, 1: on)
seta r_mapoverbrightbits				"2"							// brightness rendering of texture pixels (lower: darker, higher: brighter)
seta r_overbrightbits					"1"							// intense of r_mapoverbrightbits, r_fullscreen must be enabled and r_ignorehwgamma must be disabled (lower: darker, higher: brighter)
seta r_gamma							"1.0"						// brightness, only useable if r_ignorehwgamma is disabled (lower: darker, higher: brighter)
seta r_intensity						"1.4"						// intensity of texture colors (lower: darker, higher: brighter)
